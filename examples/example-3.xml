It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the leader of an elite military rescue team on a mission to save hostages in guerrilla-held territory in an unspecified country in Central America. Kevin Peter Hall co-stars as the eponymous antagonist, a technologically advanced form of extra-terrestrial life secretly stalking and hunting the team. Predator was written in 1984, under the working title of Hunter. Filming ran from March-June 1986 and creature effects were devised by Stan Winston.

The film's budget was around $15 million. 20th Century Fox released it in the United States on June 12, 1987, where it grossed $98,735,548. Initial critical reaction was mixed; criticism focused on the thin plot. In subsequent years, the general public's attitude toward the film became positive, and it appeared on a 2015 Rolling Stone's reader's poll list as one of the best action films of all time. It spawned three sequels, Predator 2 (1990), Predators (2010) and The Predator (2018). A crossover with the Alien franchise produced the Alien vs. Predator films, which includes Alien vs. Predator (2004) and Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007).</s>
